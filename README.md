# Unity-Shell
A CLI in Unity

## Design
### Unity Shell works everywhere
Unity Shell is designed to be able to work anywhere you can enter text in Unity. This means you can use the Shell in the Unity Editor, embed it into your game or anywhere else you may need to. The shell itself is not tied to any specific visualization.

Note: This does not mean that all features must work everywhere. Certain commands may only work in the Editor or vice versa.
